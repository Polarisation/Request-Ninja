# Settled JavaScript ESLint Config

ESLint config used by Settled.co.uk. Based on AirBnB's implementation.

## Changes / WIP
This module is a **work in progress** and will be updated as required.

## Usage
Inside your ESLint file you just need to extend from this module.

    {
      "extends": "eslint-config-settled"
    }

You also need to define your development dependencies in package.json:

    {
      "devDependencies": {
        // Always required.
        "eslint": "2.8.x",
        "eslint-config-airbnb": "latest",
        "eslint-config-settled": "latest",

        // Include other ESLint plugins as required.
        "eslint-plugin-babel": "latest",
        "eslint-plugin-import": "latest",
        "eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y": "latest",
        "eslint-plugin-react": "latest",
      }
    }
